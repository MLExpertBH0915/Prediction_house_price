# House-Price-Predictor

In this project, I have created simple model which predict the price of the house on the basis of it's area, as I used single feature for prediction that's why I preferred to go with the linear regression algorithm. And the I train the model and saved all the parameters in pickle file and then deployed that model on web using flask.
